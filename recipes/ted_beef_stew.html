        hot oil and remove to a plate lined with paper towels. Add the onion to
        the remaining oil and cook until browned. Pour the beef broth into the
        stockpot. Stir in the rosemary, thyme, and bay leaves. Season with salt
        and pepper. Return the beef to the pot. Bring the mixture to a boil;
        reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 1 hour.
